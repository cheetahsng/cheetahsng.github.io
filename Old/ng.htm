		<div id="1"><H3>Introduction</H3>
			The Cheetah is a very well known animal. But looking at it with a bit of<BR>
			research, the cheetah doesn’t always have an easy life. From its birth<BR>
			when its mother has to be careful so that it doesn’t get eaten, all the way<BR>
			to avoiding fights with other bigger predators over prey, the species don’t<BR>
			really have a good journey all the time. In fact, the cheetahs, amongst<BR>
			many other species, has been rated vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.<BR>
			There just live some 7,100 cheetahs in the wild. With conservation of<BR>
			cheetahs made an important point by many organisations, there is a<BR>
			chance to save this wonder of cats, big and small.<P>
		</div>
		<div id="21"><H3>details</h3><P>
		The cheetahs have the scientific name of “Acinonyx Jubatus”. Acinonyx<BR>
		can roughly translate to “non-moving claws” and Jubatus to “maned”.<BR>
		Cheetahs are mostly found in North, East, South Africa and some parts<BR>
		in Iran.<P>
		Many organisations have taken steps to preserve this<BR>
		endangered animal.<P>
		The adults can weigh all the way from just 21kgs to 72kgs. Their length<BR>
		can be from 1.1m to 1.5m, depending on the subspecies.<P>
		The long legs, slender body and deep chest of a cheetah is what gives<BR>
		a cheetah the ability to run faster than any other animal on land.<BR>
		A cheetah has no spots when it is born. As it grows, it starts<BR>
		sporting more than 2000 black spots on its body.<P>
		The cheetah can run with a humongous speed of 172 kmph. But, while<BR>
		stalking their prey, they don’t run all that fast, at 64 kmph. This is why<BR>
		cheetahs have a lesser chance of killing their prey.<P>
		When the prey is between a hundred and three hundred metres, they<BR>
		stalk their prey.<P>
		A king cheetah sports 3 long stripes which extend from the neck all the<BR>
		way to the tail.<P>
		Cheetahs have lines which start from their eyes and run down till<BR>
		their mouth. These lines are called tear lines and scientists believe that<BR>
		these lines help the cheetahs to protect their eyes from the harsh sun<BR>
		and see long distances.<P>
		During the day, cheetahs can see up to 5 kilometres. But, during the<BR>
		night, they can’t see all that well. That is the reason that the cheetahs<BR>
		stalk their prey in the day rather than at night, like how other big cats do<BR>
		so.<P>
		Cheetahs cannot climb trees.<BR>
		Cheetahs don’t have very sharp claws. They can’t kill their prey as easily<BR>
		as other big predators. That’s why they back off when another predator<BR>
		is planning to kill the same animal the cheetah is looking forward to kill.<BR>
		Cheetah is the only big cat which cannot roar. Instead, it purrs.<P>
		The cheetah is the only cat which can turn in mid-air while it is running.<BR>
		The cheetah is the only predator which cannot retract its claws fully in.<P>
		</DIV>
		<DIV id="22"><h3>SUBSPECIES</H3>
		Numerous subspecies of the cheetah exist. They are all unique andNumerous subspecies of the cheetah exist. They are all unique and<BR>
		beautiful in their own distinct way.<P>
		The Asiatic Cheetah has made its home in the swathes of land in Iran.<BR>
		Native to the Arabian peninsula where it split up with the cheetahs from<BR>
		Africa, this marvel of evolution is rated Critically Endangered, with a<BR>
		population of less than 50 in the wild.<P>
		The East African Cheetah has adapted to the east African savannah.<BR>
		There are some 1,960 to 2,572 mature east African cheetahs. Its length<BR>
		goes up to 135 cm.<P>
		The Northeast African cheetah has a population of less than a<BR>
		thousand. It gives up its meal to spotted and striped hyenas. It prefers<BR>
		the Soemmerring Gazelle as its prey. The depletion of the gazelle has<BR>
		caused near extinction in Sudan.<P>
		The Saharan cheetah, is a critically endangered subspecies of the<BR>
		cheetah. Their main prey are antelopes which have adapted to the arid<BR>
		areas that they live in. A sighting is rare with their dwindling population,<BR>
		but with intricate camera traps, are possible.<P>
		The Southern African Cheetah’s survival is ensured by an influx of<BR>
		evolutionary marvels and conservational efforts from both organisations<BR>
		and individuals. Like the other subspieces, this cheetah also lives in the<BR>
		savannah, grasslands and shrub lands.<P>
		<DIV id="23"><h3>THREATS</H3>
		Human encroachment is a huge problem when it comes to cheetahs. It<BR>
		is their greatest threat and doesn’t look like it’s going away any sooner.<BR>
		Cheetahs are also killed by hunters because they are viewed as a threat<BR>
		to livestock.<p>
		There is also high cub mortality due to predation by carnivores like lions,<BR>
		hyenas and other carnivores that are in competition with the cheetah.<BR>
		The cheetah is the oldest big cat. But statistics aren’t helping their<BR>
		survival. An estimate states that just about 10,000 cheetah exist in their<BR>
		stronghold, the wild.<p>
		They have lost about 80% of their historic range.<BR>
		There is no record of a cheetah ever killing a human. In fact, cheetah<BR>
		cubs are unusually easy to tame, which has led them to be smuggled for<BR>
		pets. This has a major and direct impact on their population.<BR>
		And all of this is not counting the huge problem which is faced by<BR>
		cheetahs, genetic inbreeding. Inbreeding is one of the most major<BR>
		problems faced by cheetahs. This leads to several abnormalities.<BR>
		They are absolutely vulnerable to extinction, but there is a ray of light<BR>
		and hope at the end of the tunnel.<p>
		</DIV>
		<DIV id="24"><H3>conservation</h3>
		The cheetah is also Africa’s most endangered species of big cats. Their<BR>
		numbers have declined by 90% over the past 100 years, dropping from<BR>
		100,000 to less than 10,000 today.<p>
		The current cheetah population is whilst small in numbers, covering only<BR>
		21 countries of the world.<p>
		Several organisations help the cheetah survive.<BR>
		Founded in 1990, the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia is the<BR>
		world’s leading organization dedicated to saving the cheetah in the wild.<BR>
		Although the institution of the Zoological Society of London is located in<BR>
		London, Cheetah conservation in Tanzania has been a major focus for<BR>
		ZSL since 1991.<p>
		Realising that the cheetah’s population is slowly decreasing, the Kenya<BR>
		Wildlife Trust set up the Mara Cheetah Project in order to determine the<BR>
		threats that cheetahs face.<p>
		Namibian farmers are also increasingly using the implementation of<BR>
		predator-friendly livestock management techniques.<p>
		International Cheetah Day is celebrated on 4th December to spread<BR>
		awareness about their survival and population.<p>
		The Maasai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya, the Serengeti National Park in<BR>
		Tanzania, or the Kruger National Park in South Africa are a few wildlife<BR>
		reserves which help in the conservation of cheetahs.<p>
		Sometimes, it’s safer for cheetahs to live in national parks so that they<BR>
		are protected from the negative results of human activities. Many<BR>
		national parks exist to cater this need. Some of them which also help in<BR>
		the conservation of cheetahs are the Maasai Mara Game Reserve in<BR>
		Kenya, the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and the Kruger National<BR>
		Park in South Africa.<p>
		All of these efforts by these and many more organisations and<BR>
		individuals have a huge role in helping the cheetahs survive for as long<BR>
		as possible.<p>
		You can help cheetahs and some of their other big cat siblings by<BR>
		donating to the National Geographic Big Cats Initiative<p>
